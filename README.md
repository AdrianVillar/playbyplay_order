Course Abstract:
Play by Play is a series in which top technologists work through a problem in real-time unrehearsed, and unscripted. In this course, Play by Play: Taming the Salesforce Order of Execution, Daniel Stange and Don Robins discuss the Order of Execution - the sequence of operations that are happening when a record is created or updated in Salesforce. Itâ€™s essential for Salesforce Administrators, Developers, and Architects to get a deep understanding of the Order of Execution in order to build and maintain scalable and robust applications on the Salesforce platform.
